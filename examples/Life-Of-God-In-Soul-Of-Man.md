3^ears, he prepared himself for the ministry,
andwas established in a smallyillage about
twentymilesfromAberdeen. Fromthisplace,

but,attheearh'aixeoftwenty-seyen,hishealth

closed his briefbutuseful career. One year
before his departure, this inyaluable treatise
was giyen to the world. It was modestly
written, only for priyate use; but Bishop
Burnet, seeing it, appreciated it so highly
that he hastened to giye it to the world

bothwith theexcellent purposes itcontained,
andthegreatclearnessandpleasantnessofthe

Some timeafter,another editionofthis in-

## MistakesaboutReligion

T CANNOT speak of religion, but I must
lament,that,amongsomanypretenders to
it, so fewunderstand w^iat it means: some

notionsandopinions; andalltheaccountthey

can give oftheirreligion is,that theyareof
thisorthe other persuasion, and havejoined
themselvestooneofthose manysectswhere-
into Christendom is most unhappilydivided.
Others placeitintheoutwardman,in a con-
stantcourseof externalduties,andamodelof
performances: iftheylivepeaceablywiththeir
neighbors,keep atemperate diet,observe the
returnsofworship,frequentingthechurchand
theircloset,andsometimesextendtheirhands
to thereliefofthepoor,theythink theyhave
sufficientlyacquittedthemselves. Othersagain
put all religionin the affections,in rapturous
heatsandecstaticdevotion; and all theyaim
at,is,topraywithpassion,andthinkofheaven
with pleasure, andto be affected with those
kind andmelting expressionswherewith they
court their Saviour, till thevpersuade them-
selvesthattheyaremightilyinlovew^ithhim;
andfromthence assumeagreatconfidence of
their salvation, w4iich they esteem the chief
ofChristian graces. Thus arethose things
which have anyresemblance ofpiety,and at
thebestarebutmeans ofobtaining it,orpar-
ticular exercisesofit,frequentlymistaken for

against theirgovernors,must have the name
ofChristian couracre and resolution.

## THE FREEDOM ANDUNXONSTRAINEDXESS OF

```
RELIGION.
```
A GAIN, religion may be defined by the
name of life^ because itis aninward,
free,andself-movingprinciple;andthosew^ho
havemadeprogressinit,arenotactuatedonly


in the SoidofMan,

byexternal motives, driven merelybythreat-
enings,norbribedbypromises,norconstrained
by laws; but are powerfullyinclined to that
which is good,anddelightintheperformance

## ofit. The lovewhich a pious manbears to

Godandgoodness,isnotsomuchbyvirtueof
a command enjoining him so to do, asby a
newnatureinstructingandpromptinghimtoit

```
;
```
nor dothhe payhis devotionsas an unavoid-
abletribute,onlytoappeasethedivinejustice,
orquiet his clamorous conscience; but those
religious exercises are the properemanations
of the divine lite, the natural employments

## of the new^-born soul. He prays, and gives

thanks, and repents, not only because these
things are commanded,but ratherbecausehe
is sensible of his w^ants, and of the divine
goodness,andofthefollyandmiseryofasin-
ful life. His charity is not Ibrced, nor his
almsextorted from him: his love makeshim
willingtogive; andthoughtherewerenoout•

sirous to perform his duties with more spirit

divine life, which, though it be faint and
weak, will surely be cherished bythe influ-
ences ofheaven, and growunto greater ma-
turity. Buthewho is utterlydestitute ofthis

ofheaven, can no more be accounted a reli-
gious person, than a puppetcan be called a
man. This forced and artificial religion is
commonlyheavyand languid,likethemotion
of a weight forced upward: it is cold and
spiritless, like the uneasy compliance of a
wife married against herwill, who carries it
```
## dutifully toward the husbandwhom she doth

notlove,outofsomesenseofvirtueorhonor.
Hence also this religion is scant and nig-
gardly, especially in those duties which do
greatestviolenceto men's carnalinclinations;
andthoseslavishspiritswillbe sure to do no
more than is absolutelyrequired: itis a law
thatcompelsthem,andtheywillbeloathtogo

## ever be putting such glosses on it, as may

leavethemselvesthegreatestliberty; whereas
the spiritoftruereligion isfrank andliberal,
far from such peevishandnarrowreckoning;
and he who hath given himselfentirely unto
God, will neverthink he doth too much for
him.

## RELIGION A DIVINE PRINCIPLE.

```
T3Y this time I hope it doth appear, that
rehgion is, with a great deal of reason,
termed a lifc^ or vital principle; and that it
isver}'necessarytodistinguishbetweenit,and
that obedience which is constrained and de-
pends on external causes. I come next to

only in regard to its fountain and original,
havingGodforits author, and beingwrought
inthesouls ofmenbythe powerofhisHoly
Spirit; but also in regard of its nature, reli-
gionbeingaresemblanceofthedivineperfec-
tions, the image ofthe Almighty shining in

of his nature; it is a beam of the eternal
light, a drop ofthat infinite ocean ofgood-

## WhattheNaturalLifeis

T3EFORE I descend to a more particular
consideration ofthat divine life wherein
truereligiondothconsist,itwillbefittospeak
a little of that natural or animal lifewhich
prevails in those who are strangers to the

## other. AndbythisIunderstandnothingelse,

but our inclination and propension toward
thosethingswhich are pleasing and accepta-
ble to nature; or self-love issuing forth and
spreadingitselfintoasmanybranchesasmen

rootandfoundationoftheanimallifeIreckon
tobesense,takingitlargely,as itis opposed
unto faith, and importeth ourperception and
sensationofthings thatare either grateful or

tions considered in themselves, and as they
areimplantedin us bynature, are notvicious
or blamable; nay, they are instances ofthe

the while flow from one and the sameorigi-

whereas others are naturally serious and se-

such gravity as gains them a great deal of

some, rugged, and morose temper, and can
neither be pleased themselves, nor endure
that others should be so. But all are not
bornwithsuchsourandunhappydispositions;
forsomepersonshaveacertainsweetnessand
benignity rooted in their natures, and they
find the greatest pleasurein theendearments

that nature hath provided this complexional

tendernesstosupplythe defectoftrue charity
inthe world,and to incline mento do some-
thing for one another's welfare. Again, in
regard of education, some have never been
taught to follow any other rules, than those
of pleasure or advantage: but others areso
inuredtoobservethestrictestrulesofdecency
and honor, andsome instancesofvirtue,that
they are hardly capable of doing any thing
which they have been accustomed to look
upon as base and unworthy.
In line,it is no small difference in the de-

soul thus possessed with divine love, must
needs be enlarged towards all mankind in a
sincere and unbounded affection, because of

'T^HEnext branch of the divine life is an
universal charityandlove. Theexcel-

generous than a heart enlarged to embrace
the whole world, whose wishes and designs

universe,whichconsidereth everyman'sinter-

## estas its own? Hewho loveth his neighbor

injurious thought, or be wanting in expres-
sions ofbounty: he had rathersufferathou-
sandwrongs,thanbeguiltyofone; andnever
accountshimself happy, but when some one
or other hath been benefited by him. The
malice or ingratitude of men is not able to
resist his love: he overlooks their injuries,
and pities their folly, and overcomes their
evilwith good; and never designs anyother
revengeagainst his mostbitterand malicious
enemies,thantoputall theobligationshecan
upon them, whether they will or not. Is it
anywonderthat suchapersonbe reverenced
and admired, and accounted the darling of
mankind? Thisinward goodnessandbenig-
nityofspirit reflects acertain sweetness and
serenity upon the very countenance, and
makes it amiable and lovely. It inspireth
the soulwith anoble resolution andcourage,
and makes it capable of enterprising and
effecting the highest things. Those heroic

and universal affection must be much more
powerfuland efficacious.

## benign. Had I m}^ choice ofall things that

## pitch upon this, to have my heart possessed

with the greatest kindness and aflection to-

## would make me partakein all the happiness

## fortand pleasure. Andthough I should fre-

quenth^ meet with occasions of grief and
compassion,yetthereis a sweetness in com-
miseration, which makes it infinitely more
desirable thana stupidinsensibility: and the
consideration of that infinite goodness and
wisdom which governs the world, might re-
press any excessive trouble for particular
calamities that happen in it: and thehopes
orpossibility ofmen's after-happiness, might
moderate their sorrow for their present mis-
fortunes. Certainly, next to the love and
enjoyment of God, that ardent charity and
affectionwherewithblessed souls do embrace
one another, is justly to be reckoned asthe
greatest felicity of those regions above: and

THE DELIGHTAFFORDED BY PURITY.
A ND this purity is accompanied with a

defiles the soul disturbs it too; all impure
